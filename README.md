# Marvel Mantras

## Project Overview

Marvel Mantras is an interactive front-end application developed as part of a group project. The application leverages multiple server-side APIs to provide users with an engaging and dynamic experience. This project showcases our ability to build a responsive and polished web application that can be presented to potential employers.

## What We Learned From This Project

Working collaboratively on Marvel Mantras allowed us to hone our skills in communication, time management, and project division. We applied our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and visually appealing application. This project reinforced the importance of using external APIs, client-side storage, and creating responsive layouts.

## Project Requirements

Our project fulfills the following requirements:

- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
- Deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Interactive (accepts and responds to user input).
- Uses at least two server-side APIs.
- Includes one modal (does not use native browser alert, confirm, or prompt functionality).
- Uses client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Responsive.
- Polished UI.
- Clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## User Story
